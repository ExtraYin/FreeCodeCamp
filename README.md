# FreeCodeCamp

I used a <a href="https://github.com/petehunt/react-webpack-template">react-webpack-template</a> as my website starter kit.

To compile these <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React projects</a>, you should first "cd" into the project directory and then run "npm install" and "webpack -p" in command line.
